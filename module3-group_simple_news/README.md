# A Simple News Site:

# Notes:
- Two user has already been created (with a few posts made) in the news website. They are: Username: newsuser1, Password:test; Username: alice, Password:aaa.
- For the creative portion, we implemented: 
    - The support where you can search for a certain user in the home page and display all stories made by them. You also have the option to clear your search and return to the normal home page.

    - The implementation of the option to like each story and display the likes each story received in each story's detail page.


Grade: 70/75. -4 for not passing CSRF tokens when deleting comments and stories. +2 for site being visually appealing and extra effort. -3 not enough content for creative portion. If the like feature kept track of individual user's likes and prevented them from liking the same thing more than once than full credit would have been granted
