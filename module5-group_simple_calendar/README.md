# A Simple Calendar Site:

- http://ec2-13-113-251-204.ap-northeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com/~edochin/module5-group-module5-group-473824-496841/calendar.php

# Notes:
- Please don't click on Previous Month / Next Month or Turn Tags On/Off too quickly.
- Refreshing won't log a user out. Only clicking on the Log out button would.
- One user has already been created (with a few events made) in the calendar website. He is: Username: jefferson, Password:123. Of course, the almighty TA can register their own account using the register button. (as long as they follows the format)
- For the creative portion, I implemented: 
    - You can optionally tag events, and turn on/off the display of tags in your calendar. If turned on tag-display, only tagged events with the tag will be displayed. If turned off, all events would be displayed.

    - After logging in, the log in header section would be replaced with a welcome message. Tag-display button, Share button, Logout button, and all events would not be available for guest users.


Grade: 64/75. Explanation: -2 for using XHR requests instead of fetch. -2 for using var in places other than the given calendar library. +1 bonus for going above and beyond for CSS styling. -8 for the creative portion as much more functionality could have been implemented...
